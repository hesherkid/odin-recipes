            <h2>About the dish</h2>
            <p>This one pan dish is sure to be a hit with bright and complex flavours. You will look like a professional
                chef to your family when you make this dish.</p>
            <p>One of my favourite parts about this dish is the runny fried egg on top of the hash that adds an extra
                layer of creamy goodness. Breakd the yolk let it run and mix it all up to ensure every bite is creamy
                and delicious.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425<span>F</span>. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces. Place potatoes on the baking sheet and toss with 1/2 tbsp oil, season with salt and pepper. Roast in the middle of the over, flipping halfway through cooking until golden brown, 18-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the potatoes roast, core then cut pepper into 1/2 inch pieces. Finely chop parsley. Thinly slice green onions. Half tomatoes. Peel, then mince the garlic. Thinly slice onion. Stir together mayo, half the parsley and 1/4 tsp garlic in a small bowl and set a side.</li>
                <li>Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil then onions. Cook stirring often, until  slightly softened, 2-3 min. Add vinegar and 1 tsp sugar. Season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until dark gold-brown, 7-8 min. Remove pan from heat. Transfer onions to another small bowl and set aside. Carefully wipe pan clean.</li>
                <li>Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil then peppers. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3-4 min. Add chorizo and remaining garlic. Cook, breaking up chorizo into smaller pieces, until no pink remains, 3-5 min. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li id="special-direction">While the chorizo and peppers are cooking, heat a medium non-stick pan over medium-low heat. When hot add 2 tbsp butter and swirl pan, until melted. Crack in two eggs. Pan-fry covered until egg white is set, 2-3 min. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. (Note: the yolk should be runny. Also if preffered, pan-fry eggs using 1 tbsp oil instead).</li>
                <li>Add roasted potatoes, tomatoes, half the green onions and remaining parsley to the pan with the chorizo. Stir together. Divide hash between plates or bowls and top with carmalized onions. Dollop with parsley aioli. Sprinkle remaining green onions and top with fried egg. Enjoy!</li>
